#
# Shared greyscale-safe styling for manuscript figures.
#
# WHEN THIS FILE APPLIES
#   Strategus itself produces no manuscript figures. Its outputs are result
#   tables in a results schema, browsed interactively through the OHDSI Shiny
#   viewer (see docs/UsingThisTemplate.md). Neither is what a journal receives.
#
#   Manuscript figures come from an OPTIONAL custom step / Word report layered
#   on top of the Strategus run — the pad-amp-ed-desc hybrid pattern. If this
#   study has no such step, nothing sources this file and it costs nothing.
#   If it does, every figure it draws must go through here.
#
#   See docs/FIGURES.md for the convention and a worked example.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS
#   Journals commonly print in greyscale, and the default reflex — one hue per
#   series — fails badly there. Hues chosen to look distinct on screen tend to
#   have near-identical LUMINANCE, so desaturating collapses them to a single
#   indistinguishable grey. In the study this was extracted from, a four-curve
#   calibration overlay used navy / red / green / orange; in greyscale all four
#   became one line. The same figure's reference diagonal was `dotted`, which
#   was also the linetype of one model curve, so that curve disappeared into
#   the reference line even BEFORE any greyscale conversion.
#
#   The fix is redundancy, not a better palette. Every multi-series figure
#   draws colour, linetype AND shape from one fixed table (.gs_series_palette)
#   via .gs_scales(): three independent channels, so a figure survives a bad
#   photocopy and not merely a clean PDF desaturation.
#
#   Never assign per-figure hex colours to a new series. Add a slot to
#   .gs_series_palette instead — that is also what keeps figures agreeing with
#   each other. Before this table existed, a study's ROC and calibration
#   figures had drifted onto different palettes and the SAME model appeared
#   orange on one figure and green on the next.
#
# EXPORTS
#   .gs_series_palette         — the fixed grey/linetype/shape encoding table
#   .gs_scales()               — scale_colour/linetype/shape triple for N series
#   theme_manuscript()         — shared ggplot2 theme, print-legible base size
#   save_figure()              — writes a ggplot as matched 600dpi TIFF + PDF + PNG
#   .calibration_axis_limits() — data-driven square limits for calibration plots
#   .calibration_reference_line() — the shared perfect-calibration diagonal
#   .png_aspect()              — read a PNG's aspect ratio for Word embedding
#
# WHY A SEPARATE FILE
#   Report modules are typically sourced conditionally (only when a report is
#   requested), while analysis code may draw figures regardless. Keeping the
#   styling in its own file lets every caller source it directly; the guard
#   below makes repeat sourcing a no-op.
#
# DEPENDENCIES
#   ggplot2, patchwork (panel stacking), and optionally ragg (600 dpi TIFF
#   device — see the soft-load note below; there is a working fallback).

#
# It is the preferred TIFF device (best text rendering), but it compiles
# against system libraries — libpng, libtiff, freetype, harfbuzz, fribidi. The
# portable bundle's installer only does `module load R` on the protected
# analytic space and provisions no system packages, so ragg may legitimately
# fail to install there. A hard library(ragg) would then abort the entire
# analysis at load time over a figure-device preference, after every other
# package had installed fine.
#
# save_figure() falls back to grDevices::tiff() when this is FALSE. The
# fallback still produces 600 dpi LZW TIFF; only the text rasterisation
# differs.

# .gs_series_palette
#
# Fixed, ordered greyscale encoding table. Slot order is significant — the
# Nth level of a factor always gets the Nth row, never chosen by name — so a
# given series keeps the same appearance regardless of which OTHER series are
# present. Build the factor in a stable order and a 2-, 3- and 4-curve variant
# of the same figure will agree with each other.
#
# Slots 1-4: primary series (e.g. model curves). Black then mid-grey, filled
#   then hollow shapes, so the first two read as most prominent.
# Slots 5-6: reserved for SUBORDINATE reference series — things like a
#   decision curve's "Treat all" / "Treat none", which must sit visually
#   behind the primary curves. Pass `slots = c(seq_along(models), 5, 6)` to
#   .gs_scales() to pin them there; see that function's note on why the
#   default numbering is wrong for this case.
#
#   slot  colour   linetype   shape                                   reads as
#   1     black    solid      16 (filled circle)                      primary, filled
#   2     black    longdash   17 (filled triangle)                    primary, filled
#   3     grey45   dotdash    0  (open square)                        secondary, hollow
#   4     grey45   dotted     5  (open diamond)                       secondary, hollow
#   5     grey70   solid      1  (open circle)                        reference, hollow
#   6     grey70   dashed     2  (open triangle)                      reference, hollow

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# .gs_scales()
#
# Returns the scale_colour_manual()/scale_linetype_manual()/scale_shape_manual()
# triple for a set of factor levels, sliced from .gs_series_palette in order.
#
# Arguments:
#   levels — character vector of factor levels, in the order they should be
#            assigned palette slots (i.e. the same order used to build the
#            plotting data frame's factor column).
#   slots  — optional integer vector, same length as `levels`, naming which
#            .gs_series_palette row each level takes. Defaults to 1, 2, 3, ...
#
#            Pass this explicitly whenever some series are semantically
#            SUBORDINATE and must land on the reserved reference slots (5-6)
#            regardless of how many primary series precede them. The decision
#            curve is the motivating case: with four models the defaults
#            happen to be right (4 models + 2 references == slots 1-6), but
#            with one model "Treat all" would otherwise inherit slot 2 —
#            black, filled triangle — and render MORE prominently than the
#            model curve it is supposed to sit behind. Callers should write
#            slots = c(seq_along(model_names), 5, 6).
#
# Returns a named list with elements $colour, $linetype, $shape — each a
# ggplot2 scale object, meant to be added to a plot with `+`. Errors if more
# levels are requested than the palette has slots (rather than silently
# recycling colours, which would defeat the whole point of this table).

# journal column at final print scale — the previous default of 11pt/base
# ggplot2 sizing was tuned for on-screen viewing, not the ~3.3in column width
# these figures are actually reproduced at) with the legend pinned to the

# save_figure()
#
# Single save path for every manuscript figure, replacing the ~16 separate
# `ggplot2::ggsave(..., dpi = 150)` PNG-only calls that used to be scattered
# across this file and report_prognostic.R. Journal submission requires
# print-resolution raster (600 dpi TIFF) and/or vector (PDF) figures; 150 dpi
# PNG is only adequate for on-screen review, so this now writes all three
# from one ggplot object:
#   <file_stem>.tiff — 600 dpi, LZW-compressed, via ragg::agg_tiff when ragg
#                       is installed, else grDevices::tiff() (see .HAVE_RAGG)
#   <file_stem>.pdf  — vector, via the Cairo PDF device (scales losslessly)
#   <file_stem>.png  — 150 dpi, kept for on-screen review and for
#                       officer::body_add_img(), which cannot embed TIFF/PDF
#
# Arguments:
#   plot          — a ggplot object
#   output_folder — directory to write into (created if missing)
#   file_name     — base file name; any extension is ignored/replaced (e.g.
#                   passing "roc_curve.png" and "roc_curve.tiff" both produce
#                   the same three-file set with stem "roc_curve")
#   width, height — figure size in inches
#   dpi           — resolution for the TIFF; PNG is always saved at 150 dpi
#                   since it is a screen/Word-embedding artifact, not a
#                   submission file

# .calibration_axis_limits()
#
# Shared data-driven square axis limits for every calibration plot.
#
# WHY: the reflex is to hardcode limits = c(0, 1) on both axes, since these are
# probabilities. But predicted risk is usually concentrated in a narrow band —
# in the study this came from, every curve sat inside x [0.09, 0.75] and
# y [0, 0.50], so a fixed unit square left ~60% of the panel empty and crammed
# every curve into one corner. Zooming to the data is the single biggest
# legibility win, independent of the greyscale requirement — and it matters
# MORE in greyscale, because curves that overlap in a cramped corner are
# exactly the ones grey levels alone cannot separate.
#
# Pass EVERY value that will be drawn, not just the binned means. If a marginal
# distribution strip plots per-patient risks under the panel, those individual
# values routinely fall outside the range of the bin means, and because both
# panels share the axis ggplot will silently drop the out-of-range points —
# from the one panel whose job is showing where patients are.
#
# The panel stays square (same limits on both axes) so the 45-degree
# perfect-calibration diagonal remains a true 45 degrees and the plot is not
# visually misleading.
#
# Arguments:
#   values — numeric vector of every value that must be visible (typically
#            c(predicted, observed) across all curves)
#   pad_frac — fractional padding beyond the data range (default 8%)
#
# Returns a list with $limits (length-2 numeric, clamped to [0, 1] since risk
# and observed rate are probabilities) and $breaks (pretty breaks inside them).

# The perfect-calibration diagonal, as one shared geom so every calibration

#
# Thin, light grey, SOLID. Deliberately NOT "dotted" or "dashed": slots 3 and
# 4 of .gs_series_palette use those linetypes, and a reference line sharing a
# linetype with a data series is indistinguishable from it — that exact bug
# hid a model curve inside the reference diagonal in the study this came from.

# aspect ratio the figure was actually saved at, or the image is stretched.
# Hardcoding the ratio at the embed site duplicates a number that lives in the
# plotting code, and silently goes wrong the moment a figure's dimensions
# become dynamic — which they now are: .save_dual_calibration_plot() sizes
# itself from the number of curves. Reading the real file cannot drift.
#
# Parses the IHDR chunk (PNG spec: 8-byte signature, 4-byte length, 4-byte
# "IHDR", then width and height as big-endian uint32) rather than taking a
# dependency on the `png` package for two integers.
